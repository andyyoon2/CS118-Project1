CS 118 Project 1 Team Member Information

Team Members:
Calvin Chan UID: 404144970
Kenneth Shi UID: 304063313
Andrew Yoon UID: 903912647

In general, all three team members worked pretty closely and tried not to 
give just one person a specific task since we all wanted to learn about how
sockets worked. We all worked together on different parts, but if needed to 
split up the work, the bullet points are below. A lot of time was spent on
debugging previous issues and rewriting a good portion of the code. Andrew
wrote the base http proxy initial setup, and Calvin/Kenneth worked together
on writing the cache. After getting basic object fetching to work, Andrew
worked on setting up a RAM cache that we would end up rewriting together,
while Calvin/Kenneth worked on parsing headers and setting up persistent 
connections. After implementing the cacher, we worked together to fix issues
and get some tests working. 

Calvin Chan:
	- Worked to rewrite code after changing from RAM cache to on disk cache
	- Set up the expiration checker for cached data
	- Wrote code that parsed headers to be sent/received from the client
	- Organized main() so only 20 processes could run at a time. 
	- Debugged a lot of issues with our client recieving 

Kenneth Shi:
	- Rewrote code to change RAM cache into disk cache
	- Support for persistent connections as well as non-persistent connection
	- Organized code structure and merging code together
	- Wrote code to save data to our cache and to read data from our cache

Andrew Yoon:
	- Wrote base code for setting up our HTTP server
	- Set up the proxy client as well as the proxy server side
	- Wrote all the sockets reading/writing code 
	- Implemented timeout checking for receiving data from server/client
	- Added in error exception
	- Setup the initial RAM cache, later worked to reimplement into on disk
